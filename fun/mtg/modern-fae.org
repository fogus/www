I used to run a fairly vanilla mono-blue faeries deck with counters and tempo plays. However, over time the faeries decks 
have become relatively weak compared to the rest of the field. Therefore, I'm now running a blue/black faeries control list with
a transformational sidebaord that turns it into a narset lock strategy. If I ever wanted to play this deck seriously then I'd go
a different direction but for now it's like playing two decks in one.
